Description: This package makes it possible to perform analyses using
        the MSGFplus package in a GUI environment. Furthermore it
        enables the user to investigate the results using interactive
        plots, summary statistics and filtering. Lastly it exposes the
        current results to another R session so the user can seamlessly
        integrate the gui into other workflows.
